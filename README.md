# To Tomb it may Concern

![Image not loaded.](https://github.com/j4cobgarby/To-Tomb-it-may-Concern/blob/master/github/screenshot01.png "A screenshot!")<br>

A pretty simple 3D dungeon crawler written in LibGdx.
It's - as you'd expect - written almost entirely in Java.
In fact, the only parts not written in Java are a few utilities
for generating assets, which are written in Python.<br>
It's my *first* 3D game, as far as I can remember.<br>
The models are all created in Blender, then exported using
[some special Blender addon I found](https://github.com/Dancovich/libgdx_blender_g3d_exporter), meaning I can import
objects as a `.g3dj` file, which is very useful.<br><br>
At the time of writing this, you can't do much in the game.
You can walk around a hardcoded level, and look at the amazing
graphics!<br>
In the future, there will be a lot of enemies to fight -
probably bosses too. An inventory system will also be
implemented, and a lot of new weapons and cool stuff like that!
